#  Video Progress Tracker

A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to upload lecture videos, track which parts have been watched, and resume playback from where they left off ‚Äî with unique progress tracking, even if segments are re-watched or skipped.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Upload videos to Cloudinary
- Display uploaded videos in a sidebar
- Watch videos with automatic resume from last position
- Track unique watched intervals (skipping doesn't count)
- Vertical progress bar with percentage
- Completion popup when 100% is reached

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary

## üì¶ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karansarda121/Progress-Tracker.git
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install

#  .env file
No need to setup already present 

# Start the server
node server.js
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd progress-tracker
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Note: 
-By default, the frontend is configured to make API calls to the production backend hosted on Render.
You can find the Axios instance configuration in:
client/src/services/api.js

-To use your local backend instead, update the baseURL in api.js to:
const API = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:5000' // Local server
});

## Design & Logic Explanation

###  Watched Intervals Tracking
On every `onTimeUpdate` event in the video player, we:
- Record a small time window (e.g., `start = currentTime - 2`, `end = currentTime`)
- Save this segment into `localStorage` under the video ID
- Segments are stored as `{ start, end }`

###  Merging Intervals for Unique Progress
We implemented a merge function that:
- Combines overlapping or touching segments
- Calculates total unique time watched from these merged intervals
- Computes progress = `(uniqueWatchedTime / videoDuration) * 100`

###  Resume From Last Position
- On video load, we retrieve the last `currentTime` from localStorage
- Seek video to that position via `videoRef.current.currentTime`

###  Completion Popup
- When progress reaches 100%, a small popup shows: `‚úÖ Task Completed!`
- It auto-disappears after 3 seconds

##  Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Accurately Calculating Unique Watch Time**
**Challenge**: Users could re-watch or skip portions.
**Solution**: Store and merge watched intervals to ensure progress only grows with truly unseen parts.

### 2. **Cloudinary Upload Delays**
**Challenge**: Uploads seemed done but weren‚Äôt fully processed.
**Solution**: Removed misleading progress bars, used simple state like `Uploading... Please wait`.

### 3. **Resuming Playback Smoothly**
**Challenge**: Seeking before metadata was loaded caused errors.
**Solution**: Used `onLoadedMetadata` to set `currentTime` only when video is ready.
